# Shunk ðŸŽ²

**Shunk** is a fun and strategic 2-player dice game where players take turns rolling the dice, banking points, and racing to reach 100 points first. The game combines luck with strategy, as players must decide whether to risk rolling for a higher score or play it safe and bank their points. If a player rolls a 1, their current turn's score resets to zero, and they must pass the turn to their opponent. The first player to accumulate 100 points wins!

## Features
- **2-Player Mode**: Play head-to-head with a friend!
- **Dice Roll & Hold Mechanics**: Roll the dice to add to your current score, but be careful! If you roll a 1, you lose all points for that turn. You can also hold and bank your points to play it safe.
- **Winning Threshold**: The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game.
- **Game Animations**: Includes animations for the dice, player turns, and errors, enhancing the user experience.
- **Canvas Confetti Celebration**: When a player wins, a burst of colorful confetti celebrates the victory!

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**: The core technologies powering the game.
- **canvas-confetti**: A lightweight library used to create fun, celebratory confetti animations when a player wins.
